Note 1 Information: Max data length bin: 152  < max pop len bins: 200; so will accumulate larger pop len bins
Note 2 Suggestion: This model has just one settlement event. Changing to recr_dist_method 4 and removing the recruitment distribution parameters at the end of the MG parms section (below growth parameters) will produce identical results and simplify the model.
Warning 1 : Fleet:_1min bound on parameter for size at peak is 5; should be >= midsize bin 2 (11.5)
Warning 2 : Fleet:_1min bound on parameter for size at peak is 5; which is < min databin (20), so illogical.
Warning 3 : Final gradient: 0.000278331 is larger than final_conv: 0.0001
Warning 4 : poor convergence in Fmsy, final dy/dy2= -0.0733229
Note 3 Information:  N parameters that are on or within 1% of min-max bound: 6; check results, variance may be suspect
